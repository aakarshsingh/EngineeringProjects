# EngineeringProjects
This portal allows engineering students to share ideas about projects that can be done during their school time.

This projet is inspired by the awesome-conferences project by [@RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt) and O-Reilly conferences by [@Stephn-R](https://github.com/Stephn-R)

It compiles a list of projects undertaken by engineering students.
The aim is to help new students, with project ideas and their implementation as well as the possibility of guidance or assistance/advice

The following contributions are planned:
1. Adding country flag sprites
2. Adding more languages and defining levels
3. Currently assuming that inter-branch projects can be entered. Can add more features to add support for different branches.
4. Improving search(?)
