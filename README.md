# EngineeringProjects
This portal allows engineering students to share ideas about projects that can be done during their school time.

This projet is inspired by the awesome-conferences project by @RichardLitt and O-Reilly conferences by @Stephn-R.

It compiles a list of projects undertaken by engineering students.
The aim is to help new students, with project ideas and their implementation as well as the possibility of guidance or assistance/advice
